# Bridgelinx React Test Task

## Information

Solution for Bridgelinx React test task by Fahad Ahmad. The app uses OMDB to get a list of movies based on what the user searches. Clicking on a certain movie shows specific details for that movie and also allows the user to add a review for the movie and read the reviews written by others. 

## Tech
* React for frontend (functional components with Hooks - useState, useEffect, useHistory, and React Router). 

* Node and Express used for backend, MongoDB for database.

* OMDB API used with fetch to get all titles, and axios used to get reviews database data. 

* Bootstrap, CSS3, and Sass used for styling.

## Testing the app locally

* [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)

* Run the following command in the root directory: 
 
### `npm run dev`

This should run both the backend server and frontend as well.
